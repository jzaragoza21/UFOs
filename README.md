## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to upgrade the 'UFO Finder' webpage so that the page has a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by adding javascript functions. We used javascript to make this webpage and table of data more dynamic. For example, the prior webpage only allowed users to filter UFO sightings by "date. In this project, we upgraded the page by adding more filters such as "city, state, country and shape" in addition to "date." 

## Results

As noted above, the prior webpage only allowed users to perform a search of UFO sightings by "date" and to get back results the user had to click on the button for the search to be applied. in the upgraded version, users can now generate UFO sightings by inputting one or many of the following criteria of date, city, state, country and/or shape. The first image below demonstrates this. Additionally, we added a function that allows UFO sightings from the table of data to be generated by simply inputting criteria into one of the filters without clicking any button. The second image below demonstrates this.
