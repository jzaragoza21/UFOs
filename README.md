## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to upgrade the 'UFO Finder' webpage so that the page has a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by adding javascript functions. We used javascript to make this webpage and table of data more dynamic. For example, the prior webpage only allowed users to filter UFO sightings by "date. In this project, we upgraded the page by adding more filters such as "city, state, country and shape" in addition to "date." 

## Results

As noted above, the prior webpage only allowed users to perform a search of UFO sightings by "date" and to get back results the user had to click on the button for the search to be applied. in the upgraded version, users can now generate UFO sightings by inputting one or many of the following criteria of date, city, state, country and/or shape. The first image below demonstrates this. Additionally, we added a function that allows UFO sightings from the table of data to be generated by simply inputting criteria into one of the filters without clicking any button. The second image below demonstrates this.

## Summary of Analysis

The first glaring drawback is this webpage does not resize on mobile or tablet devices. If we were to continue to build and upgrade this webpage, the first recommendation would be to use javascript to add formatting so that the webpage responds accorindgly to commonly used mobile and tablet devices.

As for two additional recommendations for further development, the two are as follows:

   - First, I would recommend a way in which users could visit the website and upload their own UFO sightings experience. This way we could help grow the dataset and to keep the data clean, they could only upload data that falls within the established criterion of "date, city, state, country, shape and comments."
   - Secondly, I would recommend we develop a some type of global heat map. Not only would it make this webpage more visually appealing and user friendly but most importantly, it could help identify any geographic trends with UFO sightings.
